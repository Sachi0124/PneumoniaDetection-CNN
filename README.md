# 🩺 Pneumonia Detection AI  
### Chest X-ray Diagnosis using CNN & Transfer Learning (MobileNetV2)

> **An intelligent AI-based system to detect Pneumonia from Chest X-ray images with high recall and clinical accuracy.**

---

## 🚀 Why this Project?

Pneumonia is a serious lung infection that can be life-threatening if not detected early.  
Manual analysis of Chest X-rays is time-consuming and depends heavily on expert availability.

This project uses **Deep Learning + Transfer Learning** to provide:
- **Fast**
- **Consistent**
- **High-recall**
diagnosis support.

## 🎯 What Does the System Do?

✔ Accepts Chest X-ray image  
✔ Preprocesses and resizes image to 128×128  
✔ Passes image through trained CNN model  
✔ Predicts **NORMAL** or **PNEUMONIA**  
✔ Displays **confidence score**  
✔ Generates **final diagnostic report**

All inside a **professional Streamlit web application**.
